Today, I learn python concurrent from [[https://python3-cookbook.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/c12/p08_perform_simple_parallel_programming.html][python3 cookbook]].

Bellow is some exampels for using concurrent.

* submit

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session
import concurrent.futures

# Some function
do = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

def work(x):
    print(f"x: {x}")
    return x

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as pool:
    # Example of submitting work to the pool
    future_result = pool.submit(work, do)

    # Obtaining the result (blocks until done)
    r = future_result.result()
    print(f"r: {r}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: x: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
: r: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

* map
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session
with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as pool:
    # Example of submitting work to the pool
    future_result = []
    for i in pool.map(work, do):
        future_result.append(i)

    # Obtaining the result (blocks until done)
    print(f"r: {future_result}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: x: [1, 2, 3]
: x: [4, 5, 6]
: r: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
